###Collaborate in Real Time  
Code is synchronized in real time between everyone on your team.

All data is sent over an encrypted websockets connection.

###Integrated Voice Chat

Tests designs with clients without needing to setup a server!

###Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting for all web languages is supported.  
MultiHack is built with <a href="https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror">CodeMirror</a>, so adding new highlighting is a breeze!  

###Network With Other Users
